      In 2000, Mikkelsen married choreographer Hanne Jacobsen, whom he had been dating since 1987. They have a daughter, Viola (born 1992), and a son, Carl (born 1997).

      Mikkelsen lived in Copenhagen all his life, except when living in Toronto while filming Hannibal. Today he is based in Denmark, but also spends a lot of time on the Spanish island of Mallorca, where the Mikkelsen family has a house.

      He is often voted the "sexiest man" in Denmark in polls. Mikkelsen is irreligious.

      Honours
      On 15 April 2010, Mikkelsen was appointed Ridder (Knight) of the Order of the Dannebrog. In April 2016, the French government appointed Mikkelsen a Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
